# edge_coloring
Edge coloring for bipartite graphs

Contains a python implementation of Noga Alon's algorithm for edge-coloring bipartite graphs, described in 
the paper: "A simple algorithm for edge-coloring bipartite multigraphs", Inf. Process. Lett. 85(6): 301-302 (2003)

The graphs are represented using Rustworkx, see https://github.com/Qiskit/rustworkx.
